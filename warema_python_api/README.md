API for Warema Blinds (Local operation: time mode)

This API is designed for a setup made of a RaspberryPi 3 with an AutomationHat adapter.

In this setup, the relays one and two are used.

Relay one is connected to pin (?) and 24V (pin P) and moves the blind upwards.
Relay two is connected to pin (?) and 24V (pin P) and moves the blind downwards.

Other:
Window blind takes 36 seconds to go from the upper most position to the bottom most position.
The window blind only tilts in one direction, from 0° to 75°, which takes exactly one second.
