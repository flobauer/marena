PYTHONPATH=./ python ../../face_classification_emotion_recognition/src/video_emotion_gender_demo.py

Requirements:

Python 3.6
Tensorflow backend
Keras
OpenCV

We are using yolo alogorithms to detect face region in an image and then we are using Pre trained- Deep convolutional neural networks to classify whether particular person is man or woman and than we are classifying its emotions(happy,sad,neutral).
